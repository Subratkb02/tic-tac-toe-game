Overview:
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

Features:

- Two-player mode: Alternates turns between Player X and Player O.
- Win detection: Automatically detects and announces the winner based on predefined win patterns.
- Draw detection: Declares the game a draw if all nine cells are filled without a winner.
- Reset functionality: Allows players to reset the game and start over.
- Responsive design: Adjusts the game layout for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
